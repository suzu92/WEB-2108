            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>My interests circles around things of the creative and imaginative sort,
                I happily lose myself in daydreams and start inventing all sorts of stories and
                conversations in my minds. Whether it's a simple walk at the graveyard or cleaning up in the
                kitchen, I tend to write it down or draw it in a notebook to reflect on it later.
                I am a quite slow person, when it comes to sport or activities I tend to prefer to go for longer
                walks and do yoga rather than run and go to the gym.
                Usually I spend most of my time with my parter and rabbit, either drawing or reading.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>This part about me could be going on for eternity. I feel like I can't stop myself for getting
                curious about new things all the time. Embarrassingly I don't really want to comment on all I've studied
                before, the list is quite long. But I suppose the part I'd like to highlight, is the artistic interest
                that have started to grow again after a few years of working as machine operator at a security firm.
                I have studied animation and illustration, both of which I love to do but since I'm a very introverted
                person, I've had difficulty finding job. When I got unemployed due to budget cuts I took the opportunity
                and applied for a program in web developing and here we are!</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Work</h1>
            <p>It really goes without saying if you managed to read through to section above, I've done a lot of
                different things. The last few years, as I wrote above, I've worked at a security firm. Can't say
                anything about the work there, silence agreement and all that, but I like it there a lot. I've also
                worked a little with market communication and translation work at my parents company. It is probably
                what I want to do at some point but with more freedom, they tend to use templates for most things, and
                I'd like to create my own, new thing.</p>
