        <p>
            I tend to start with a very rough sketch. I usually don't have a clear image in my head, I make a rough
            sketch
            with some basic shapes and figures. Most of the time I lean back on things I find easier to draw, like
            animals,
            flowers and female shapes. I don't want too much open or empty space in the illustration,
            I might not see them right away though and add elements as the piece comes together. Today I started with a
            flat
            pink circle and started to sketch around it to get a basic composition. Once I'm overall happy with how the
            placement turns out I follow up with some more detailed line-art.
        </p>
        <p>
            First I’ll lower the opacity of the rough sketch layer and place a new one on top of it. I find it easier to
            see
            what lines I want to trace and which to discard. I might add a few more details but not this time. Actually,
            today I got really lazy and just copied one of the flowers and rotated it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I have finished the clean line-art, I go it over once again and add small details here and there.
            For line-art I use Procreate’s Dry Ink brush with the default settings because I like the texture the best.
            It works well with both flat and textured colors. In this piece I'm thinking of keeping to flat colors.
            I don't want to take to long on this illustration, I know that I want this drawing to have an easy feeling.
            Solid block colors should do it..
        </p>
        <p>
            I often spend way too long playing with colors, and this time wasn't any different. I landed on a color
            palette
            I usually don't use to try and explore something different. I'm not sure if I like it, honestly...
            It's a bit hard to see each element with this palette. Might change it later. In this one it's okay since
            there's
            not a lot going on but if I had way more objects and shapes I would've chosen a different palette.
            I began color-blocking in a new layer and gave it a few quick shadows with alpha lock.
            <br><br>
            And that's about it. That's all I managed to do today.
